# Classifying-Iris-Flower-Species-with-Decision-Trees-
This project focused on using decision trees to classify the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset consists of measurements from three different species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica
For each flower, four features are provided: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of this project is to build a decision tree-based classification model that can accurately identify the Iris species based on these features.

**Key Objectives:**
Data Exploration: The initial step in this project will involve exploring the Iris dataset to understand its structure and characteristics. Visualizations and statistical summaries will be used to gain insights into the distribution of features and the class labels.

Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing is essential to ensure the dataset is suitable for training a decision tree classifier. This step may include checking for missing values, handling categorical data (if any), and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Decision Tree Model Building: The heart of this project is constructing a decision tree classifier. The decision tree algorithm will recursively split the data based on the features' values to create a tree-like structure, enabling accurate classification of the Iris species.

Model Visualization: Visualizing the decision tree is crucial for understanding its decision-making process and interpreting the classification rules it learned.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the decision tree's performance is vital to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be used to measure the model's effectiveness.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the decision tree's hyperparameters, such as the maximum depth of the tree or the minimum number of samples required to split a node, can significantly impact the model's performance.

Feature Importance: Analyzing the importance of each feature in the decision tree can provide valuable insights into which characteristics are most influential in distinguishing between Iris species.

Overfitting Prevention: Decision trees are susceptible to overfitting, especially when the tree is deep and complex. Techniques like pruning or limiting the tree's depth will be explored to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
